# Automating the Sample Preparation and Genotyping of Mosquito Larvae

### Overview and pre-automation preparation
We have attempted to automate two key parts of a laborious mosquito genotyping protocol; larvae sample preparation, and multiplexed PCR.
Note that before running this code, the preparation of a 96-well plate already containing a single larva in each well is necessary.
  This includes the manual exclusion of larvae from the 'Dil' wells (B3, D6, and F9), by not placing larvae here.
  Unfortunately, the individual placement of live larvae into each well was not possible to automate in the timeframe of this project.

The reservoirs must be carefully prepared as follows:
A1: overall Master Mix for the PCR step
A2: water
A3: overall mixed lysis buffer for the sample preparation step (DNARelease Additive + Dilution Buffer, 5ul/250ul, thoroughly mixed and vortexed)
A4: same as A3, overall lysis buffer in the first 9 wells of the reservoir, except for the last well which has water just for the control (will be H12 in the PCR plate)

Note that depending on the genotyping-specific PCR being carried out, the master mix composition in the A1 reservoir wells will have different primers.
The A1 Master Mix must also be prepared taking into account that for a 10ul PCR reaction volume. 
Instead of adding 0.25ul of the gDNA, 1ul (of a more dilute sample) will be added, so 0.75ul less water will be added in preparing the overall MM.
